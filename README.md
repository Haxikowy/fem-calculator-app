## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript ES6+

### What I learned

Generally I improved my ES6+ JS, also learned a bit about CSS Grid and a lot about CSS variables <- they are awesome!

```css
.themeselector-dot {
  background: var(--t3-hlighted-bg, var(--t2-hlighted-bg, var(--hlighted-bg)));
}
```

You can nest them to create "select theme thing"!

### Continued development

I need to develop my JavaScript skills, that was part I had most problems with. Now I'm really comfortable with HTML & CSS.

### Useful resources

- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid) - This helped me for better understanding of CSS Grid. I like this website, because it's making hard things easy to understand.

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Helped me with Syntax!

- [Web Dev Simplified](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw) - He's awesome guy, helped me with understanding whole calculator feature.
